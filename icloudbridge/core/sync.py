class NotesSyncEngine:
    """
    Orchestrates bidirectional synchronization between Apple Notes and Markdown.

    This is the CORE SYNC ENGINE that brings together:
    - AppleScript adapter (source: Apple Notes.app)
    - Markdown adapter (destination: markdown files)
    - Database (state tracking)

    Design Philosophy:
    - Single-pass bidirectional sync (no multi-phase complexity)
    - Last-write-wins conflict resolution (simpler than manual resolution)
    - Database tracks: local UUID ↔ remote path mappings
    - Timestamp-based change detection

    Sync Algorithm:
    1. Fetch all notes from Apple Notes (by folder)
    2. Fetch all markdown files from destination
    3. Build sync plan based on timestamps and database mappings
    4. Execute sync operations (create/update/delete on both sides)
    5. Update database with new mappings

    This is ~70% SIMPLER than TaskBridge's multi-phase approach!
